PhoenixPlugins
Phoenix-GUI -- Plugin that is lightweight and allows me to create UI's efficiently patterns are noticeable.


TODO:
1. Save the Widget Information through JSON instead of using the SaveGame functionality of UE5
2. Implement Drag and Drop with maybe a snapping functionality.
3. Interface so it can be used on any widget.
4. Test functionality of the PhoenixScreen Widget.
5. Need to Package it.
